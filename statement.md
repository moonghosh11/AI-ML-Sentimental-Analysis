Everywhere, including in messages, reviews, comments, and social media posts, people voice their opinions.  However, it is challenging, time-consuming, and not always accurate to manually read and comprehend the emotion behind each sentence.

 Finding straightforward projects that demonstrate how machines can comprehend fundamental human emotions is another challenge faced by many novices who wish to learn AIML.

 The goal of this project is to provide a straightforward and understandable tool that can:

 Take any phrase that the user says.

 Determine if the feeling is neutral, negative, or positive.

 Provide prompt feedback regarding the sentiment

 The objective is to use Python to develop a lightweight sentiment analysis system that doesn't require big datasets or intricate algorithms.
 The fundamental concepts of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and how computers understand human language are made easier for users to grasp with this approach.
